    "**Pulsars** are rare neutron stars, as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium and the state of matter, which are very important for the study and development of natural sciences. The search for pulsars relies mainly on detecting signals emitted by periodic broadband radio emission patterns (averaged over multiple rotations) as they rotate at high speeds. However, in practice, all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, so it is difficult to find legitimate signals. Hence, the search for **real** pulsars is challenging.

As we experimented with different splits, we came to a conclusion that the 75-25 split would be the most appropriate solution. Also the initial_split function allows us to shuffle and stratify the data to prevent the order from influencing the outcome and to ensure that the proportion of each class is preserved between the training and testing split.”()"
